# CIS-5200---SYSTEMS-ANALYSIS-AND-DESIGN

**Project Overview**

This research project delves into customer behavior patterns within an online eCommerce multi-category store, aiming to interpret and analyze data related to customer buying and viewing behavior. 
The primary objective is to glean valuable insights into user requirements and enhance our understanding of customer engagement in the e-commerce domain.

**Introduction**

Dataset Details: The project utilizes a dataset comprising customer behavior data for October and November 2019.

Dataset Size: 5GB with 10 columns, including time, type, product id, category id, category code, brand, price, user id, and user session.

Analytical Focus: The analysis centers around deciphering customer buying behavior and comparing patterns in two distinct months, October and November, contributing to a holistic view of customer engagement.

**Research Background**

Comparison to Previous Studies:

While leveraging a Kaggle.com dataset, this study differentiates itself by employing Big Data analysis using Hive.
In contrast to a 2020 study utilizing Python 3 libraries, our project utilizes Hadoop and Beeline for data manipulation and analysis, expanding the analytical scope.

**Specifications**

Dataset Coverage: Spans two months, October and November 2019, from a large multi-category online store.

Accessibility: Publicly available in CSV format with a size of 14.68 GB.

Scalability: Asserts applicability to datasets ranging from 100 GB+ to as small as 25 MB, demonstrating scalability and adaptability.
